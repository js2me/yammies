## [yummies/utility-types](src/utils/types.ts)  
TypeScript utility types that simplify writing TypeScript code.  
They can be imported globally using the `d.ts` file, embedding it in the environment  
```ts
import 'yummies/utility-types';
```  
Or specified in `tsconfig.json` in the `"types"` field    
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": [
      "yummies/utility-types"
    ],
    "target": "...blabla",
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
Alternatively, you can use the "library" approach, where you need exported types.  
For this, you can use the `yummies/utils/types` import.

```ts
import { AnyObject } from 'yummies/utils/types';
```


## [yummies/complex](src/complex/index.ts)
